Laser Harp
==========

This project was created for ECE 110 at Illinois during Spring 2014. It was somewhat successful, and I'm dumping all the files here for anyone who might be interested. Please forgive any horrendous code and/or code formatting, I've chosen to leave it unchanged for posterity. If I remember correctly, the Arduino simply controlled a brushless DC motor via a PWM-controllable ESC. The computer software used OpenCV for image recognition, but I cannot recall whether the final version was written in C++ or Java. The 3D design files were made in SketchUp and exported as SVGs so that they could be laser cut from acrylic and plywood. Some photos of the final product are available in the media folder.
